# Network-On-Chip-Based-System-Design

This repository contains the code and findings for my Design Project (BITS Pilani â€“ CS F377).

# Overview

- Worked on finding an optimal mapping of tasks for a given application communication graph onto tiles of a 2-D mesh topology graph so that the total number of microring resonators to be turned on in optical crux routers is minimum, under the XY routing mechanism.

- Formulated the above problem as an ILP model and solved it using ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio.
